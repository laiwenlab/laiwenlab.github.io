# Research

We are intrested in cell adhesion mechanisms, and how adhesion signaling drives various cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. In particular, we are interested in studying how leukocytes, especially neutrophils, adhere to blood vessels and trigger inflammation leading to immune disorders. Neutrophils are often the first immune cells to reach sites of inflammation, where they release cytotoxic species that kill bacteria, fungi, and other pathogens. Exacerbated inflammation causes collateral tissue damage and is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as inflammatory heart disease and stroke. We strive to gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms of leukocyte adhesion in inflammation.
